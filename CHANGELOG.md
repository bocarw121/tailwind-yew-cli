# 0.1.4
- Fixed an issue where the installation process was overwriting the existing index.html file. 
- If an index.html file already exists, the link will be inserted in the head tag
- If it does not exist, the index.html file will be created and the template will be used. 
- Special thanks to [@dmgolembiowski](https://github.com/dmgolembiowski) for identifying and reporting this issue.
